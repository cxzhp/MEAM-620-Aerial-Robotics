# MEAM-620-Aerial-Robotics
MEAM 620 is an advanced graduate-level course for students interested in robotics research.  The goal of the class is to expose students to the mathematical foundations of planning, control, and vision, and to train them in developing real-time planning and control software modules for mobile robotic systems. This project-oriented course will focus on quadrotors, but students will be able to apply the principles to more general mobile robotic platforms.
